# Accessibility - Compendium
## A thoughtfully composed suite of opinions and best practices for Designers and forgetful Developers

## Introduction

## Where does accessibility start?
Accessibility doesnâ€™t start with developers. It starts at _the start_ of the project. 
Accessibility, at the very least should be baked into the culture of the company producing the product.
The first physical implementation of accessibility will probably be at the design stage.
