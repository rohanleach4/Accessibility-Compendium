# Accessibility - Compendium
## A thoughtfully composed suite of opinions and best practices for Designers and forgetful Developers

## Introduction

## What is accessibility and where does it start?

Accessibility is a broad term. It not only covers people with disabilities, but also those with mobile devices and slow internet connections.
Accessibility can be looked on as a mechanism that intends to treat everyone the same.
Accessibility doesnâ€™t start with developers. It starts at _the start_ of the project. 
Accessibility, at the very least should be baked into the culture of the company producing the product.
The first physical implementation of accessibility will probably be at the design stage.
